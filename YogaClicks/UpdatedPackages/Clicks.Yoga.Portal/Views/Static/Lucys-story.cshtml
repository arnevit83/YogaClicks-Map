                        I was a burnt out corporate, working eighty hour weeks in advertising. Nothing

                        in my life was working, so I decided to straighten myself with six months in the

                        yoga schools of India.
                        <br /><br />




                        <b>It was there I learnt the three skills that were to change my life:</b>
                        <br /><br />
                        Switching off the negative thinking.<br />

                        Waking up to my creativity.<br />

                        Finding the courage and resilience to make my ideas happen.

                        <br /><br />



                        <b>Out of this stillness the creativity flowed.</b><br /><br />

                        I came home with a suitcase full of diaries and the knowledge that my happiness

                        lay in writing. A year later Random House published Yoga School Dropout.

                        <br /><br />

                        Suddenly I was getting emails from all over the world. As I shared my story

                        readers shared theirs – how yoga was also helping them get healthy, happy and

                        creative. How they were leaving old lives behind to become designers, artists,

                        photographers, filmmakers, entrepreneurs … The list went on and on.

                            I created YogaClicks so we could inspire each other with this

                            transformative power of yoga - for health, happiness and creativity.
